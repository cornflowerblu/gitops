https://github.com/timescale/tobs for a great monitoring stack.

Linkerd installs best on its own from the getting started. 

Cert manager requires argo but it's a 2 second install if you're not setting up DNS.
It's very easy to port forward it as well! Along with most of the monitoring tools.

Linkerd has a plugin for Jaeger!! So hopefully they can trace the pods and then we can use it for the operator and collector.
